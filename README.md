##Serial Port Sniffer
This tool allows the user to view traffic between 2 COM ports in various data formats.

##Use
To use the Serial Port Sniffer application, click the icon in the toolstrip and then select the ports that you wish to view the traffic between. You can then open and close these ports, 'rename' them to make debugging less confusing, and change the format in which the data is viewed.
